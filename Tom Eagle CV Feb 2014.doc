Employment History

Project assistant EcoVert Solutions Oct 2012 to present

EcoVert provides solutions to problems such as damp period properties, often caused by unsympathetic use of modern materials. Natural materials like lime mortars, hemp, cork and wood-wool insulation are used in their place, that also have low embodied energy and a low carbon footprint.

EcoVert also works with modern properties and offers retrofit and new build consultation and construction services, up to PassivHaus levels.

National Trust Volunteer (Wales environment team) March 2012 – March 2013

In the role of environment volunteer, I worked with the EPA’s (environmental practice advisers) in Wales.
